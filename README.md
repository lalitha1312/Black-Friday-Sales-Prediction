# Black-Friday-Sales-Prediction
This project aims to predict the sales that happened at a retail store at the time of Black Friday Sale which is very popular among western countries
We obtained a raw sales dataset and applied regression and classification algorithms to find the maximum sales of the product.
In regression, we used Gradient Boosting Regressor, XG Boost, Random Forest Regression, Ada Boost regressor for fitting the data and making predictions.
Now for classification, Decision Tree algorithm and Knn Means algorithm were used.
